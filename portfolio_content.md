## 1. About Me

### Layout Suggestions:
- **Two-Column Layout:** A professional headshot on one side and a brief, engaging introduction on the other.
- **Compelling Headline:** Start with a strong headline that immediately communicates your professional identity (e.g., "DevOps Engineer | Cloud Architect | SRE").
- **Social Proof:** Include links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and other relevant professional profiles.

### Design Notes:
- **Clean and Professional:** Use a modern, clean design with a professional color palette (e.g., blues, grays, and a single accent color).
- **Readable Typography:** Choose a sans-serif font like Lato, Open Sans, or Roboto.
- **White Space:** Use ample white space to avoid a cluttered feel.

### Sample Copy:

## 2. Projects

### Layout Suggestions:
- **Filterable Card Gallery:** Display projects in a grid of cards with filter buttons above (e.g., "All," "Infrastructure as Code," "CI/CD").
- **Project Cards:** Each card should include a project title, a short description, technology tags, and links to a live demo and source code.
- **Detailed View:** Clicking a card should open a modal or a separate page with more details (problem, solution, your role).

### Design Notes:
- **Visual Consistency:** Ensure all cards have a uniform size, padding, and font style.
- **Interactive Elements:** Use hover effects on cards. The active filter button should have a distinct visual style.
- **Scannable Tech Stacks:** Use icons for technologies to make the tech stack for each project quickly recognizable.

### Sample Project Description (Detailed View):
> **Title: Automated CI/CD Pipeline for a Microservices Application**
>
> **Summary:** I designed and implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a containerized e-commerce application, reducing manual deployment efforts by 95% and cutting down release times from a full day to under 15 minutes.
>
> **The Problem:** The development team was struggling with a slow, error-prone manual deployment process.
>
> **My Solution:**
> *   I built a multi-stage pipeline using **Github Action** that automated the entire workflow: building Docker images, running tests, performing security scans with **Trivy**, and deploying to a **Kubernetes** cluster.
> *   I containerized the application's microservices using **Docker** for consistent environments.
> *   The pipeline deployed to **AWS EKS** with separate stages for dev, staging, and production.
>
> **Technologies Used:** Github Action, Docker, Kubernetes (AWS EKS), Helm, SonarQube, GitHub.

## 3. Certifications & Badges

### Layout Suggestions:
- **Grid of Badges:** Display your certifications as a grid of official badges (3 or 4 columns).
- **Link to Verification:** Make each badge image a clickable link to the official verification page (e.g., Credly).
- **Informative Tooltips:** On hover, display a tooltip with the full certification name and issue date.

### Design Notes:
- **Official Imagery:** Use the official, high-quality badge images.
- **Consistent Sizing:** Use CSS to ensure all badge images are displayed at a uniform size.

### Sample Certifications:
- AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional
- Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
- HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate

## 4. Technical Stack

### Layout Suggestions:
- **Categorized Groupings:** Group skills into logical categories (e.g., Cloud Platforms, IaC, CI/CD, Containers).
- **Multi-Column Layout:** Arrange the categories into two or three columns for scannability.
- **Icons/Logos:** Use official logos for each technology next to its name.

### Design Notes:
- **Clear Hierarchy:** Use bold, clear headings for each category.
- **Avoid Proficiency Bars:** Do not use subjective skill bars or percentages. Simply list the technologies you are proficient with.

### Sample Content:
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **CI/CD & Automation:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog
- **Programming & Scripting:** Python, Go, Bash

## 5. Blog / My Articles

### Layout Suggestions:
- **Grid or List of Cards:** Display articles as a series of cards.

## 6. Contact CTA (Call-to-Action)

### Layout Suggestions:
- **Centered Block:** Place this at the bottom of the page with a distinct background.
